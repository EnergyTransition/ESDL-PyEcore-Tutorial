    "<a href=\"https://energytransition.gitbook.io/esdl/\">Energy System Description Language (ESDL)</a> is a modelling language created for modelling the components in an energy system and their relations between each other. It also includes dynamic information about the system such as profiles, geographic information such as  location and space, and information about costs. ESDL is capable of expressing the dynamic behaviour of components in the energy system. For instance, the power consumption of a neighbourhood. ESDL describes components by their basic functionality (so called Energy Capabilities), these are modelled in five abstract categories: Production, Consumption, Storage, Transport and Conversion. ESDL enables energy modellers to model a complex energy system in a generic way. The language is machine-readable so makers of energy transition calculation tools and GIS applications can support ESDL in order to enforce the interoperability of their products."

In this example, profiles are stored as <a href=\"https://energytransition.github.io/#router/doc-content/687474703a2f2f7777772e746e6f2e6e6c2f6573646c/DateTimeProfile.html\">DateTimeProfile</a> to show it in ESDL. However, this creates an ESDL element for every profile value, which can lead to a very long ESDL file. Therefore, it is recommended to store your profiles in an InfluxDB using <a href=\"https://energytransition.github.io/#router/doc-content/687474703a2f2f7777772e746e6f2e6e6c2f6573646c/InfluxDBProfile.html\">InfluxDBProfile</a>.\n",
